/**
 * Interface to libpenntotalrecall, being a the generic form for a C interface to a native shared library that can render audio on behalf of a <code>PrecisionPlayer</code>.
 * 
 * We use this approach instead of generating bindings for an entire native audio library since we will only use a handful of functions and wish to minimize latency and processing overhead.
 * 
 * WARNING if using FMOD implementation: streamPosition() must be called frequently in order to cause FMOD's system to update.
 * 
 * Updated for FMOD Core API compatibility.
