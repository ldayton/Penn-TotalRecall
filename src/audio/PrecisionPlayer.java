/**
 * Specification for an audio playback system appropriate for high-precision tasks, such as linguistic annotation.
 *
 * <h3>Overview</h3>
 * A PrecisionPlayer keeps track of two kinds of audio playback: main playback and short-interval playback.
 * Main playback is fully controlled, allowing stopping, changing of loudness, etc., and represents the user moving through an audio file.
 * Short interval playback, in contrast, cannot be stopped once started, nor is there any guarantee that loudness of short intervals can be changed once started. 
 * It is anticipated that users will replay short intervals around the main playback point as they make judgments about
 * their audio annotations.
 *
 * <h3>Goals</h3>
 * The overriding optimization goal of any implementation (after minimum guarantees are met) 
 * should be to minimize the latency of the play and stop methods, and to increase the accuracy of the stop method's 
 * return value.
 * 
 * <h3>Precision</h3>
 * Play methods are exact. That is to say, the frames they play meet the parameters of the method call exactly.
 * The stop method returns an approximate value, a concession to the realities of audio software and hardware buffering.
 * This is why there is no resume() function: in almost any implementation the resumption frame cannot be guaranteed identical
 * to the frame reported by the pause/stop method.
 * 
 * <h3>Error Handling</h3>
 * Implementations should handle exceptions internally, other than when the exceptions are declared thrown in this interface.
 * This is especially crucial for native code implementations.
 * Error reporting is handled through reporting <code>PrecisionPlayer.EventCode.ERROR</code> events to registered listeners.
 * 
 * <h3>Audio Formats</h3>
 * Implementations should strive to support at least the sampled sound audio types supported by Sun's reference implementation of
 * Java Sound: AIFF, AU, WAV, 8 or 16 bit samples, mono or stereo, 8KHz-48KHz sampling, with linear, a-law, or mu-law PCM.
 * Frames are identified with zero-based numbering.
 * 
 * <h4>Implementation-specific Behavior</h4>
 * Implementers should minimize the use of methods not defined here. 
 * Implementation-specific information should ideally be gathered by providing overloaded versions of the constructor, but a default 
 * constructor must always be provided.
